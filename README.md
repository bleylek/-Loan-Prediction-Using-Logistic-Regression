Loan Prediction Using Logistic Regression

Project Overview:
This project aims to predict loan eligibility based on customer details. We use a logistic regression model to analyze historical loan data and identify patterns that determine whether a loan should be approved or denied.

Dataset:
The dataset, loanfile.csv, contains various attributes of loan applicants, such as credit history, marital status, employment status, and loan amount. This information is crucial for predicting the likelihood of loan approval.

Methodology:
The project follows these steps:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers to improve dataset quality.
- Data Exploration: Analyzing the distribution of variables and their relationship with loan approval.
- Feature Selection: Identifying the most significant variables that impact loan approval.
- Model Training and Testing: Implementing logistic regression to predict loan eligibility and evaluating the model's performance.

Results:
We discuss the accuracy of the logistic regression model and its effectiveness in predicting loan eligibility. Key insights from the data exploration and the impact of selected features on the model's performance are also highlighted.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for implementing
